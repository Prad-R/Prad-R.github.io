subtitle: Adaptive Sampling Approach for Voronoi Diagrams of 3D Spheres
---

In this project, I came up with a radial projection based adaptive sampling algorithm that allows an computation of Voronoi diagrams for 3D spheres. This would be useful for optimal sensor location and protein studies. Benchmarks on the Voronota protein dataset have been run and have given accurate results.

The image shows the sequential results of implementing the algorithm on 4 arbitrary spheres in space. The same algorithm is extended with no changes for an arbitrary number of spheres.
