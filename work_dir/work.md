### Projects

Some of my favorite projects are listed below:
- <a href="/work_dir/gnns">Graph Neural Networks for Rainfall Variability</a>  
  Developing GNN architectures to model spatio-temporal rainfall patterns over India using GSMaP ISRO data.
- <a href="/work_dir/vd">Adaptive Sampling Approach for Voronoi Diagrams of 3D Spheres</a>  
  Proposed a computationally efficient method for constructing 3D Voronoi diagrams with non-uniform sampling.
- <a href="/work_dir/diceforge">DiceForge: A PRNG in C++</a>  
  Designed a state-of-the-art pseudorandom number generator with appropriate statistical validation.
- <a href="/work_dir/srfp">DSMC for Simulating Rarefied Gas Flow</a>  
  Implemented the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to analyze non-continuum flow regimes in aerospace applications.
